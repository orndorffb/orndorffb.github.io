	When I decided that I wanted to start a blog I did what any sane person would do. I started to come up with a vastly over-complicated design. What front-end framework? I'm a real developer, I shouldn't use something off the shelf, I need to build something fancy!<br>
	I went through all that and spent a lot of time coming up with a cool idea, how I would use some fancy new tech and learn something. In all the time I was thinking about it, I wasn't actually making any content. That is pretty lame.<br>
	So I came up with what I have here. A static html site with some chatgpt generated css to get some passable hosted on github pages. That's it and I like it so far.
